PM: Good afternoon everyone. Let's go through our weekly project sync for the Customer Portal Redesign. Overall status first - we're currently tracking amber. Let me explain why.

Dev Lead: Before we dive in, we finished the user authentication module yesterday, which was the biggest risk item. So that's a major milestone complete.

PM: That's great news, thanks Kevin. That moves us closer to green. Let's do our progress updates around the room.

Dev Lead: From the dev side, authentication is done as I mentioned. We're now working on the dashboard components. We've completed 4 of the 7 planned widgets. The remaining three are in progress and should be done by Friday.

Designer: Design is on track. All the new dashboard mockups are approved. I'm now working on the settings pages. One thing to flag - the client requested some changes to the color scheme yesterday which will require some rework.

PM: How significant is that rework?

Designer: About two days of extra work. It affects the component library we built.

PM: Okay, let's discuss that in risks. QA, how are we looking?

QA Lead: We've completed testing on the auth module - found 3 critical bugs which dev has already fixed. We're now building out the dashboard test cases. We're blocked on getting access to the staging environment though.

Dev Lead: I thought that was set up last week?

QA Lead: The credentials were wrong. I've been back and forth with IT about it.

PM: I'll escalate that today. Can't have QA blocked. Now let's talk about risks and issues.

Designer: The color scheme change is a risk to our timeline. If we absorb it without adjusting scope, we might slip by a few days.

PM: What if we deprioritize the settings pages polish and handle that in phase 2?

Designer: That could work. The core functionality would still be there, just with the original styling.

PM: Let's propose that to the client. Kevin, any risks from your side?

Dev Lead: The third-party payment integration is coming up next sprint. We still don't have API documentation from the vendor.

PM: When do you need it by?

Dev Lead: Ideally by next Wednesday so we can plan properly.

PM: I'll follow up with procurement today. They own that vendor relationship.

QA Lead: Just the staging access issue from my side.

PM: Noted. Decisions needed: one, do we absorb the color change or descope? I'm recommending descope. Two, do we escalate the vendor API docs to leadership? I think yes.

Dev Lead: Agree on both.

PM: Good. Next steps: I'll handle the staging access escalation and vendor API follow-up today. Kevin, please update the sprint board with the auth completion. Sarah, put together the descope proposal for the client call tomorrow. QA, once you have staging access, prioritize the dashboard testing.

Everyone: Got it.

PM: We'll sync again Thursday for a quick check-in. Thanks everyone.
