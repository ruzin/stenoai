Facilitator: Alright team, welcome to our Sprint 14 retrospective. We had a pretty eventful two weeks, so let's dig into what went well, what didn't, and what we can improve. Let's start with the positives - what went well this sprint?

David: I think the collaboration between frontend and backend was really smooth this sprint. We had daily sync calls and it really helped avoid the integration issues we had last time.

Lisa: Agreed. Also, the new code review process is working great. Reviews are happening faster and the quality of feedback has improved.

Marcus: From my side, I was really happy with how we handled the production incident on Tuesday. We detected it quickly, communicated well, and had it resolved within an hour.

Facilitator: Those are great callouts. The daily syncs and code review improvements were both action items from last retro, so it's nice to see those paying off. Anything else?

David: Oh, and the new testing framework Marcus set up is saving us a lot of time. Our test suite runs 40% faster now.

Facilitator: Excellent. Now let's talk about what didn't go well or was frustrating.

Lisa: The scope creep was real this sprint. We committed to 8 stories but ended up with 12 because stakeholders kept adding urgent requests.

Marcus: Yeah, that was painful. We ended up working late several nights to get everything done.

David: I also felt like our estimation was off. The payment integration took way longer than we thought - we estimated 3 points but it was really more like 8.

Lisa: That's fair. We underestimated the complexity of the third-party API.

Marcus: One more thing - the staging environment was down for almost a full day. We lost a lot of testing time.

Facilitator: These are all valid concerns. Let's talk about improvements. What can we do differently next sprint?

Lisa: We need to push back on mid-sprint scope additions. Maybe we can have a rule that anything new goes to the next sprint unless it's truly critical.

Marcus: I like that. We should also add a buffer to our estimates for anything involving external integrations.

David: For the staging environment, can we set up better monitoring? We didn't even know it was down until someone tried to use it.

Marcus: Good idea. I can set up health checks and alerts this week.

Facilitator: Great suggestions. Let me capture the action items: Lisa will draft a scope change policy, Marcus will add estimation guidelines for external integrations and set up staging monitoring, and David will schedule stakeholder training on our sprint process. Does that sound right?

Everyone: Yes, that covers it.

Facilitator: Perfect. Thanks everyone for a productive retro. Let's make Sprint 15 our best one yet.
