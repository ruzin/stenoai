Alright, let's review the Q4 numbers. Revenue came in at $2.3 million, up 15% from Q3's $2.0 million. Operating costs were $1.8 million, leaving us with $500K EBITDA.

Looking at the pipeline, we have 47 deals in stage 3, worth approximately $4.2 million. Close rate historically is 23%, so we're projecting $966K in new revenue.

Key dates: Board meeting is January 15th. Audit starts February 1st and runs through February 28th. Tax filing deadline is March 15th, but we want everything ready by March 1st.

Headcount is currently 127, with 12 open positions. Budget allows for 15 new hires by end of Q1. Average salary is $95,000, so that's roughly $1.4 million additional annual cost.

The 2024 budget proposal needs final approval by December 20th. We're requesting $12.5 million, which is an 8% increase over 2023's $11.6 million.

Any questions on the numbers? No? Good. Sarah, can you send the full report to the leadership team by COB Friday? Thanks everyone.
