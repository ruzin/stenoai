/**
 * Tiered e2e config (PR1 of the e2e plan).
 *
 *  - T1 (`*.t1.spec.ts`): renderer-only, mock IPC, no Python bundle. Runs on
 *    Ubuntu in CI under xvfb.
 *  - T2 (`*.t2.spec.ts`): real bundled backend + mock adapter / Ollama. Needs
 *    `dist/stenoai/` built; runs on macOS + Windows.
 *  - T3 (`*.t3.spec.ts`): heavy, nightly-only (the long-meeting chunking smoke).
 *    Real backend like T2 but minutes-long, so it's split into its own project
 *    and run by the scheduled e2e-nightly workflow, never per-PR.
 *
 * Tiers are selected by spec filename so CI can fan them into separate jobs.
 * `workers: 1` because every test launches a real Electron app and T2/T3 bind the
 * fixed Ollama port 11434 — serialising avoids port and resource collisions.
