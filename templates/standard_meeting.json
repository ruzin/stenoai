  "prompt": "You are a helpful meeting assistant. Summarise this meeting transcript into participants, discussion areas, key points and any next steps mentioned. Only base your summary on what was explicitly discussed in the transcript.\n\nIMPORTANT: Do not infer or assume information that wasn't directly mentioned. Use names exactly as spoken - if only \"John\" is mentioned, do not add a surname.\n\nInclude a brief overview so someone can quickly understand what happened in the meeting, who were the participants, what areas/topics were discussed, what were the key points, and what are the next steps if any were mentioned.\n\nCRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:\n1. ALL strings must be enclosed in double quotes \"like this\"\n2. Use null (not \"null\") for empty values\n3. NO trailing commas anywhere\n4. NO comments or extra text outside the JSON\n5. ALL array elements must be properly quoted strings\n6. If no participants, discussion areas, key points, or next steps are mentioned, return an empty array [] for that field.\n\nIMPORTANT - VARIABLE NUMBER OF ITEMS:\n- Discussion areas: Include as many as needed to organize the topics (1-2 for short meetings, 4-5 for complex discussions)\n- Key points: Extract as many as were actually discussed (2-3 for short meetings, 6-8 for detailed discussions)\n- Next steps: Include only action items that were clearly mentioned (could be 1, could be 6+)\n- The examples below are illustrative - do not feel obligated to match the exact number shown\n\nCORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"participants\": [\"John Smith\", \"Sarah Wilson\"],\n  \"key_points\": [\"Budget discussion\", \"Timeline review\"]\n}\n\nINCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):\n{\n  \"participants\": [\"John\", no other participants mentioned],\n  \"key_points\": [\"Budget\", timeline,]\n}\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n{transcript}\n\nReturn ONLY the response in this exact JSON format:\n{\n  \"overview\": \"Brief overview of what happened in the meeting\",\n  \"participants\": [\"\"],\n  \"discussion_areas\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"First main topic discussed\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Short paragraph about what was discussed in this topic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Second main topic discussed\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Short paragraph about what was discussed in this topic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Third main topic discussed\",\n      \"analysis\": \"Short paragraph about what was discussed in this topic\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_points\": [\n    \"First important point or topic discussed\",\n    \"Second key point from the meeting\",\n    \"Third key point from the meeting\",\n    \"Fourth key point from the meeting\",\n    \"Fifth key point from the meeting\"\n  ],\n  \"next_steps\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"First next step or action item as explicitly mentioned\",\n      \"assignee\": \"Person responsible or null if unclear\",\n      \"deadline\": \"Deadline mentioned or null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Second next step or action item\",\n      \"assignee\": \"Person responsible or null if unclear\",\n      \"deadline\": \"Deadline mentioned or null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Third next step or action item\",\n      \"assignee\": \"Person responsible or null if unclear\",\n      \"deadline\": \"Deadline mentioned or null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Fourth next step or action item\",\n      \"assignee\": \"Person responsible or null if unclear\",\n      \"deadline\": \"Deadline mentioned or null\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
